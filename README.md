# Project Name

A chat bot project made in pairs containing html, css and javascript. We wrote comments in the javascript file in order to make the code more readable and easy to follow. 

## The problem

Sometimes we got stuck with the javascript and it was hard to make the variables, conditionals and functions work together, for example how to connect the button with the input value and then make it disappear. We called the on-call support to get some help from the code coaches and it solved most of our problems. Even though we have different schedules we managed to finish the project.

# Chatbot 

A chat bot project made in pairs containing html, css and javascript. We wrote comments in the javascript file in order to make the code more readable and easy to follow. 

# What we learned

With this project, we took a big step in our learning process of JavaScript. Thanks to that project we learned: 
- how functions in JavaScript works 
- how to pass arguments to the function 
- how to use setTimeout() function
- how to use event listeners 

We are really proud of what we created. Even though we had different schedules we managed to finish the project.
